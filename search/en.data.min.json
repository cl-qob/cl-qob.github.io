Here is a list of known nested subcommands:\neask create eask clean eask generate eask generate workflow eask link eask lint eask run eask source eask test 📌 Knowing your quicklisp directory Qob creates an isolated environment, so it won\u0026rsquo;t create any side effects after playing, testing, and running your elisp packages. But it\u0026rsquo;s important to know what elpa directory (you can think of this as your .emacs.d) the current Eask session is pointing to, so you can release the full potential of this tool!\nHere is how Eask works behind the scene in different scenarios:\nName Description Options Path local The default behavior, use Eask as package dev tool n/a ./.eask config Use Eask as your package manager (It can be used as a test tool too) -c or --config ~/.emacs.d global Use Eask as a general tool, it\u0026rsquo;s unrelated to other scopes -g or --global ~/.eask You might think of why these rules are created.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to understand config and local scopes since many other build tools use the local scope to create an isolated environment. The config scope is an additional feature for people who prefer managing their packages with an external tool and not by built-in package.el or config base straight.el, so you can save up startup time to check if packages are installed for your Emacs to operate.\nSo what is the global scope in terms of Eask? Why it\u0026rsquo;s needed?\nEask is more than a build tool now. Several commands don\u0026rsquo;t require their dependencies as package dependencies. For example, the cat command:\n$ eask cat [PATTERNS..] cat is a simple command that mimics Linux\u0026rsquo;s default cat command, but it does the syntax highlighting for you! How it\u0026rsquo;s implemented? The command relies on an external package e2ansi, and this is neither the package nor config dependency (it could be, but let\u0026rsquo;s assume we don\u0026rsquo;t want it).\nHow do we use this command without side effects to your project or personal emacs configuration? The global scope is introduced for this problem. Now we can add any useful commands without worrying your environment got messed up.\nHere is the flowchart describes Eask\u0026rsquo;s lifecycle:\nBy default, Eask uses your current directory as your workspace since most of the time you would just want to operate jobs for your elisp packages.\n","description":"Qob’s CLI is fully featured but simple to use, even for those who have very limited experience working from the command line.\nThe following is a description of the most common commands you will use while developing your Common Lisp project.

But now, Eask supports various types of Emacs Lisp tasks. It can be used in three major ways:\nDev tool for Elisp packages Dependency management for your configuration Run elisp programs for all other purposes So what are the major differences between Eask and other build tools like Cask, makem.sh, and Eldev, other than the things above?\nGood question! Eask is more than a build tool now, it can be used for various purposes! But here are Eask aims to be:\nConsistent enough to sandbox across all systems General enough to have Emacsers frequently used commands (byte-compile, checkdoc, etc) Robust enough to provide useful results even in the presence of user errors Dependency-free so that the tool can be run on any platform P.S. See Why Eask? for more detailed information.\n❓ Why Eask? Eask has the same philosophy as Cask, see their site Why Cask? to understand why you should use Eask (or Cask).\nMany tools like Cask, makem.sh, or Eldev don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;really\u0026rdquo; support Windows. Cask has dropped support for Legacy Windows, makem.sh runs on bash, Eldev does support Windows, but the author doesn\u0026rsquo;t use it on Windows (not having full tests, see their CI workflows). Eask aims to adapt all platforms, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. It focuses on the cross-platform capability and the consistency between each OS. If Eask works on your machine, then it will work on any platform.\nHere are our suggestions; if you plan to work on an OS-specific package (never going to other platforms), go for other tools.
